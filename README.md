### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM. While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent. To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements. If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.

## Unit Testing
The unit testing includes three layers: controller layer, service layer, repository layer. This ensures comprehensive coverage of your application's functionality through isolated tests.

## Advanced Configuration
Using YAML for advanced configuration with profiles such as `dev`, `prod`, and `test`. This allows you to tailor the configuration to different environments efficiently.
